description: Use when a user first installs Oh My Hermes or asks to set up the product-building loop for a project

## Overview

Configures the Product Loop with minimal questions. It infers project settings,
offers defaults, and leaves unavailable integrations as non-blocking follow-up
work.

## When to Use

- User says "set up the product loop", "set up the CTO loop", or "get started".
- Required agent profiles or kanban are missing.
- A project has not saved its repository and production context.

## Prerequisites

- Hermes Agent v0.19+ with profiles, Kanban, cron, memory, and Smart Approvals.
- Oh My Hermes files installed.
- Optional: authenticated `gh` and a production URL.
- Optional: Bitwarden or 1Password configured (`hermes secrets`) — credentials
  can be sourced from vault without pasting tokens in chat.

## Procedure

1. If this is a first-time Hermes install, suggest running `hermes setup` to
   complete the configuration wizard before continuing.
2. Inspect the current git remote, package files, deployment config, existing
   Hermes memory, and authenticated CLI state.
3. Infer repository, production URL, and preferred report time where possible.
4. Ask at most one message with up to three unresolved settings. Include
   recommended defaults and: "Skip any question and I will continue with the
   defaults."
5. Never ask the user to paste a token into chat. If GitHub is not authenticated,
   provide `gh auth login` as a follow-up; continue configuring local profiles.
   If a vault is configured, source credentials from `hermes secrets get`.
6. Create or verify profiles: `cto`, `pm` (Product), `designer`, `dev`, `qa`,
   `security`, and `ops`.
7. Initialize Kanban and save available project context to memory.
8. Confirm Smart Approvals is active for routine commands:
   ```bash
   hermes config set approvals.mode smart
   ```
   This is the v0.19 default. Smart Approvals handles routine command review
   autonomously. Founder approval remains required for production release,
   rollback, and public content.
9. Create missing cron jobs only (use named jobs to avoid duplicates):
   - hourly product/backlog review when a repository exists
   - 15-minute health check when a production URL exists
   - hourly log observation when a production URL exists
   - daily status report
   - daily lightweight security check when a repository exists
   - weekly full security assessment when a repository exists
10. Confirm what works now and list missing credentials or URLs as optional next
    steps. Start from the user's product idea or current highest-priority outcome,
    not automatically from GitHub issues.
11. Run `bash ~/.hermes/scripts/setup-integrations.sh --check`. Request OpenAI
    only when it is the selected model or creative provider, Buffer at the first
    approved scheduling action, and Ark/Seedance at the first approved
    generated-video action. Never require all three during initial onboarding.
12. Set a persistent product focus (v0.19+ Checkpoints):
    ```
    /goal Build, launch, operate, and improve [product]. Keep one outcome active,
    verify before shipping, and ask only at irreversible boundaries.
    ```

## Stacked Skills (v0.19+)

Multiple skills can be chained in one invocation:
```
/clarify-requirements /product-brief start a new checkout feature
```
Use this to run intake and brief creation without a round-trip.

## Question Policy

- Read first, ask second.
- Maximum three questions in one message.
- Every question has a recommended default.
- Silence means continue with the defaults.
- Stop only when the requested next action itself requires credentials,
  payment, destructive access, licensing, or publication approval.

## Pitfalls

- Do not create duplicate cron jobs on repeated setup.
- Do not require GitHub or production deployment to begin product discovery.
- Do not reveal credentials in chat, logs, memory, or command output.
- Do not start multiple gateways for the same messaging account.
- Do not use sudo when a user-level install path exists.

## Verification

- Seven profiles and their role files exist.
- Kanban is accessible.
- Smart Approvals is set to `smart` mode.
- Existing cron jobs were reused rather than duplicated.
- Available project context is saved and missing integrations are explicit.
- The user can begin with a product outcome even without GitHub or deployment.
