# Complete Setup Guide

Everything you need before the CTO loop runs autonomously.

---

## What you need before starting

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| A VPS or always-on machine | Hermes must run 24/7 for cron and monitoring |
| Hermes Agent v0.19+ | Profiles, Kanban, Smart Approvals, stacked skills, cron, and Computer Use |
| A model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter…) | Hermes needs an LLM |
| A messaging platform (Telegram recommended) | How you receive approval requests |
| GitHub account + repo | Optional delivery surface for issues and PRs |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | Optional GitHub automation |
| Vercel account + CLI | Needed when deploying to Vercel |
| Node.js 22+ | For current CLIs and optional HyperFrames production |

---

## Step 1 — Get a VPS

Cheapest option that works: $5/month Ubuntu 22.04 on DigitalOcean, Hetzner, or Vultr.

```bash
# After SSH into your VPS:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y git curl unzip
```

---

## Step 2 — Install Hermes Agent

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
hermes --version   # should print v0.19+
```

Configure a model provider:
```bash
hermes model       # interactive wizard — choose Anthropic or OpenAI
```

Test it works:
```bash
hermes chat -q "say hello"
```

Recommended smooth build policy:

```bash
hermes config set approvals.mode smart
hermes config set terminal.sudo_password ''
```

Smart mode auto-handles low-risk commands while escalating real risk. The empty
sudo value suppresses password dialogs; agents must use project-local,
user-level, package-manager, or container paths instead. Do not disable approval
checks on the host.

---

## Step 3 — Connect your messaging platform

Telegram is the most reliable for approvals (always-on, works on any phone).

```bash
hermes gateway setup     # interactive — choose Telegram
hermes gateway start     # start as background service
hermes gateway status    # confirm it's running
```

For Telegram: the wizard will give you a bot link to open on your phone. Open it, start the bot, send a message — Hermes responds. That's your approval channel.

For Slack:
```bash
hermes gateway setup     # choose Slack, follow OAuth flow
```

---

## Step 4 — Install CLIs

```bash
# GitHub CLI
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh -y

# GitHub authentication — VPS has no browser, use a token instead of gh auth login
# 1. Go to github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens
# 2. Create a token with these permissions on your repo:
#    - Contents: Read & Write      (push code)
#    - Issues: Read & Write        (triage, comment, close)
#    - Pull requests: Read & Write (create, merge PRs)
#    - Metadata: Read              (required base permission)
# 3. Copy the token, then on your VPS:
echo "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" | gh auth login --with-token
gh auth status   # confirm: Logged in to github.com as [your-username]

# Also set it as an env var so skills can use it directly:
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel
vercel login

# Supabase CLI (if using Supabase)
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
```

## Step 5 — Install Oh My Hermes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salomondiei08/oh-my-hermes /tmp/oh-my-hermes
bash /tmp/oh-my-hermes/install.sh
```

Verify:
```bash
bash /tmp/oh-my-hermes/scripts/verify.sh
```

All items should show [OK].

## Step 5b — Configure the CTO loop agents

This creates real Hermes profiles for each agent, initializes the kanban board, and sets up cron jobs. Run it after `install.sh`:

```bash
# Set these first (see Step 7 for details):
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-fine-grained-token
export GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username
export GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo
export PRODUCTION_URL=https://yourapp.vercel.app   # optional but recommended

bash /path/to/oh-my-hermes/scripts/setup-cto.sh
```

Optional integrations are configured only when first needed. Do not paste keys
into chat:

```bash
bash ~/.hermes/scripts/setup-integrations.sh --check
bash ~/.hermes/scripts/setup-integrations.sh --buffer
bash ~/.hermes/scripts/setup-integrations.sh --seedance
bash ~/.hermes/scripts/setup-integrations.sh --openai
```

Buffer is requested at the first approved social scheduling action. Seedance is
requested at the first approved paid video generation. OpenAI is requested only
when selected as the Hermes model or creative provider.

For a fresh VPS, use the installed server bootstrap after installing Oh My
Hermes:

```bash
bash ~/.hermes/scripts/server-bootstrap.sh --project myapp --repo owner/repo --telegram
bash ~/.hermes/scripts/status.sh
```

To replace stale runtime state before a new Telegram agent:

```bash
bash ~/.hermes/scripts/reset-runtime.sh --yes
```

The script:
- Creates Hermes profiles: `cto`, `pm`, `designer`, `dev`, `qa`, `security`, `ops`
- Injects each agent's role definition into its profile
- Initializes the kanban board
- Authenticates `gh` CLI using your token (no browser needed)
- Warns if a gateway is already running (do not start duplicate gateways with the same bot token)
- Saves your repo and username to Hermes memory
- Creates missing named cron jobs for product review, health, logs, daily report,
  daily security, and weekly security based on available repo/production context

Safe to re-run — it is idempotent.

---

## Step 6 — Bootstrap your project

In your project directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
bash /path/to/oh-my-hermes/scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

This creates:
- `AGENTS.md` — fill in your project name, stack, and any constraints
- `.env.example` — fill in and copy to `.env.local`
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` — the `/api/health` endpoint Hermes checks after every deploy

**Fill in AGENTS.md.** This is important — it tells the Dev Agent what stack to use and what conventions to follow.

---

## Step 7 — Set your environment variables

Required minimum:
```bash
# In your .env.local

# GitHub — optional for issue and PR delivery
# Create at: github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained
# Permissions needed: Contents (R/W), Issues (R/W), Pull requests (R/W), Metadata (R)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-fine-grained-token
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username     # used when Hermes assigns issues to itself
GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo                   # the repo the CTO loop manages

# Vercel
VERCEL_TOKEN=             # vercel.com → Account Settings → Tokens
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=        # leave empty if using Telegram only
```

Add to Vercel for production:
```bash
vercel env add SENTRY_DSN production        # after setup-monitoring
vercel env add SUPABASE_URL production      # after connect-supabase
```

---

## Step 8 — Start the CTO loop

Tell Hermes (via Telegram, Slack, or terminal):

```
Set up the CTO loop for [owner/repo].
Send approvals to me on Telegram.
```

Hermes will inspect the project, infer available settings, ask at most three
optional questions with recommended defaults, create the seven profiles, save
available context, create missing named cron jobs, and show the kanban board.

---

## What happens next (no action needed from you)

- CTO keeps one product outcome active across Understand, Design, Build, Check,
  Ship, and Learn
- Product turns ideas, feedback, analytics, and issues into compact build briefs
- Designer defines and verifies user-facing work
- Builder implements the smallest complete increment
- Security and Reviewer independently check risk and behavior
- You choose YES, NO, CLOSE, or LATER at release
- Ops deploys, checks health, deduplicates logs, and reports actionable incidents
- Daily and weekly security jobs run when a repository is configured

---

## Troubleshooting

**Hermes gateway not responding on Telegram:**
```bash
hermes gateway status
hermes gateway restart
hermes logs gateway
```

**Kanban not showing tasks:**
```bash
hermes kanban list
hermes kanban stats
```

**Cron jobs not firing:**
```bash
hermes cron list
hermes cron status
```

**Health check always failing:**
- Check that `/api/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }` with HTTP 200
- Check Vercel function logs in the dashboard
- Check the URL saved in memory: retrieve `last-deployment`

**Build failing on Vercel but passing locally:**
- Compare Node.js version: `node --version` vs Vercel project settings
- Check Vercel env vars match your `.env.local`

---

## Minimum viable setup (just to test)

If you want to try the approval loop without the full CTO automation:

1. Steps 1–5 (Hermes + messaging + CLIs + Oh My Hermes)
2. Tell Hermes: `deploy this project to Vercel` — it runs `deploy-to-vercel`
3. After deploy: tell Hermes: `run post-deploy-followup` — it health checks and notifies you
4. Create a GitHub issue manually — tell Hermes: `implement issue #1` — it picks it up, implements, creates PR, reviews, and asks for your approval
