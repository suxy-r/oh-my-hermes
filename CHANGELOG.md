# Changelog

## 2.1.0 - 2026-07-28

### Hermes v0.19 compatibility + new automation-blueprint skill

- Updated `onboarding` to v2.1.0: `hermes setup` wizard for first-time installs,
  Smart Approvals confirmation step (`approvals.mode smart`), stacked skills
  documentation (`/skill-a /skill-b`), Bitwarden/1Password vault support, and
  Checkpoints v2 `/goal` setup.
- Updated `send-notification` to v1.2.0: Hermes Gateway is now the primary
  delivery path with durable ledger-based recovery; Slack and Telegram direct
  API are fallbacks.
- Updated `await-merge-approval` to v2.1.0: documented durable delivery and
  Smart Approvals context (routine commands are auto-reviewed; only the
  production ship decision is a founder gate).
- Updated `kanban-task` to v1.2.0: documented durable multi-agent Kanban with
  automatic retries and per-task recovery context (Hermes v2026.5.7+).
- Updated `failure-recovery` to v1.1.0: added `hermes cron history` for the
  cron durable audit trail (v0.19+); added gateway auto-resume note.
- Added `automation-blueprint` skill: defines named, parameterized multi-step
  recurring tasks as Hermes Blueprints (v0.17+) with YAML step definitions,
  approval gates, cron scheduling, and resume-from-step recovery.
- Removed `docs/improvements-to-hermes.md`: stale internal notes, most proposals
  addressed in Hermes v0.17–0.19.
- Moved `docs/x-article.md` to `content/x-article.md`: draft article belongs in
  content/, not technical docs.
- Updated `docs/setup-guide.md`: minimum Hermes version raised to v0.19+.
- README: regrouped 37 skills by category (Product, Build, Deliver, Operate,
  GitHub, Creative, Project) instead of a single 36-row flat table. Added
  stacked skills example. Added `automation-blueprint` and updated counts.
- New banner generated via Python/Pillow.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-06-19

### Product-building lifecycle

- Reworked `cto-loop` around Understand, Design, Build, Check, Ship, and Learn.
- Added a seventh permanent profile: Designer.
- Expanded Product (`pm`) to own positioning, SEO, launch strategy, and content
  planning while preserving the profile ID.
- Reframed Dev as Builder and QA as Reviewer without breaking profile names.

### New skills

- `computer-use`: guarded Hermes CUA workflow for native/authenticated GUI work.
- `product-marketing`: context, positioning, website, SEO, launch, and content.
- `creative-production`: restrained assets and HyperFrames launch video with
  music-license evidence.
- `observe-logs`: recurring, redacted, deduplicated production log review.
- `publish-with-buffer`: founder-approved scheduling through Buffer's official
  CLI, including dry runs and post-ID verification.
- `generate-with-seedance`: budget-gated video generation through the official
  Volcengine Ark asynchronous task API.
- `project-switch`, `project-status`, `failure-recovery`, `server-bootstrap`,
  `ship-this-idea`, and `reset-runtime`: first-run operating layer for fresh
  servers and multi-project work.
- `scripts/setup-integrations.sh`: just-in-time secret setup for OpenAI, Buffer,
  and Seedance in the Hermes environment without requesting keys in chat.
- Installed helper scripts now include project switching, founder status,
  dead-letter cron wrapping, safe runtime reset, fresh server bootstrap, and the
  flagship ship-this-idea launcher.

### Workflow behavior

- Replaced fixed questionnaires with read-first, maximum-three-question intake
  that continues with documented defaults.
- Made Designer responsible for `DESIGN.md` and rendered visual verification;
  external design tools are optional inputs.
- Added evidence-based Security and Reviewer gates plus YES/NO/CLOSE/LATER
  founder release choices.
- Added idempotent named crons for product review, health, logs, reporting, and
  daily/weekly security.
- Removed the incomplete tracked `examples/starter-app` because it claimed to be
  a runnable Next.js starter without the files needed to run.
- Removed the README Docker production snippet; Oh My Hermes is a Hermes skills
  pack, not an application container.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-05-09

### Added — CTO setup script and README corrections

**scripts/setup-cto.sh** (new)
- Creates real Hermes profiles (`hermes profile create cto/pm/dev/qa/ops`)
- Injects agent role definitions into `~/.hermes/profiles/$agent/agent-role.md`
- Initializes the Hermes kanban board (`hermes kanban init`)
- Authenticates `gh` CLI headlessly: `echo "$GITHUB_TOKEN" | gh auth login --with-token`
- Warns prominently if a gateway is already running (duplicate gateway = message conflicts)
- Saves `github-repo` and `github-username` to Hermes memory via `hermes chat -q`
- Sets up 3 cron jobs: hourly triage, 15-min health check, 9am status report
- Idempotent — safe to re-run; prints Pass/Warn/Fail summary

**docs/setup-guide.md**
- Added Step 5b: explains `setup-cto.sh` and its env var requirements

**README.md**
- Fixed stale "18 skills" count to "20 skills" in two locations
- Added "Configure the CTO loop" install step referencing `setup-cto.sh`

**scripts/verify.sh**
- Now checks that `setup-cto.sh` exists alongside `bootstrap.sh` and `verify.sh`

**Skills**
- `kanban-task` — creates/updates Hermes kanban cards at every stage; used by all agents
- `cto-status-report` — reads full kanban + health log, sends plain-English morning report

**Workflows**
- `cto-loop` (v2) — rewritten with full multi-agent architecture and kanban column flow

**install.sh**

## 1.2.0 — 2026-05-09

### Added — Autonomous CTO loop

**Skills**

- `review-github-pr` — self-reviews PR diff, runs build + health check on preview URL, writes plain-English founder summary
- `await-merge-approval` — sends PR summary to founder via chat platform, blocks until YES/NO, merges or feeds back into the loop

**Workflows**
- `cto-loop` — full autonomous CTO workflow: cron → triage → implement → PR → review → approval → ship

**README**
- Added "Autonomous CTO loop" section with real example of the founder Telegram experience
